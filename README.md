# Smart-Mobility-Solutions
This project simulates my role as a Data Analyst at **Smart Mobility Solutions (Pty) Ltd.**, a company specializing in traffic and logistics optimization across South Africa’s Gauteng province.

### Project Overview
We analyze real-world inspired datasets that include road infrastructure, historical speeds, incidents, weather, truck deliveries, and assignments. The goal is to:
- Monitor traffic flow and congestion
- Investigate how weather and incidents impact road speeds
- Optimize truck delivery scheduling and costs
- Support decision-making for city planners and logistics managers

This folder contains my Apache Superset dashboard export (.json / .yaml file).
The dashboard includes multiple visualizations, calculated metrics, global filters, and interactive elements created as part of the data visualization and data engineering assignments.

To import it:

Upload the exported file from this repository.

All charts, datasets, and filters will load automatically.
